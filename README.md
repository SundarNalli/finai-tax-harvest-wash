- **Policy Configuration**: View wash sale clusters and replacement rules

## Demo Data

The application comes with pre-loaded demo data including:

- **Sample Portfolio**: 6 positions with mixed P&L scenarios
- **Market Prices**: Current prices for 20+ securities
- **Wash Sale Rules**: Pre-configured clusters and alternatives
- **Recent Purchases**: Sample data to demonstrate wash sale detection

## Key Concepts

### Tax Loss Harvesting
Tax loss harvesting is a strategy to sell securities at a loss to offset capital gains taxes, then immediately purchase a similar (but not substantially identical) security to maintain market exposure.

### Wash Sale Rules
The IRS prohibits claiming a loss on a security if you purchase a "substantially identical" security within 30 days before or after the sale. This application helps you avoid these violations.

### Replacement Securities
When harvesting losses, you need to purchase replacement securities that:
- Are not substantially identical to the sold security
- Maintain similar market exposure
- Don't trigger additional wash sale rules

## Technical Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLite database
- **Frontend**: Streamlit with Plotly charts
- **Models**: Pydantic for data validation
- **Logic**: Custom wash sale detection algorithms
- **Database**: SQLite with WAL mode for performance

## Configuration

### Customizing Harvesting Parameters

You can adjust the minimum thresholds for tax loss harvesting:

- **Minimum Loss Amount**: Dollar amount threshold (default: $200)
- **Minimum Loss Percentage**: Percentage threshold (default: 5%)

### Adding Custom Securities

To add your own securities:

1. Use the database functions in `app/db.py`
